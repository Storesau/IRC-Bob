### Simple IRC / Twitch bot I made to learn python.
##### Bob supports twitch and IRC. 
##### His main (and only real) function, is to play blackjack.
##### 2 - 6 players in the twitch or IRC chat can play blackjack agains Bob.

### How to use Bob?
##### If you want to send Bob to YOUR channel on IRC or Twitch,
##### All you need to do is fill in the correct parameters with name, channel, sever and token.
##### Depending on wether you want IRC or Twitch as he cant multithread. What to fill in where
##### is specified in the comments of 'bob.py' (open bob.py with a text editor).
##### If you want Bob to run 24/7 you need a server with python2.
##### If you want Bob to run for a couple hours you need a terminal with python2.
